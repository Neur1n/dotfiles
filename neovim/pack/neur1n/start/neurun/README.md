# neurun
A shell command running wrapper for Neovim and (maybe) Vim.

Since it is written for my very personal usage instead of for general purpose
like [asyncrun.vim](https://github.com/skywind3000/asyncrun.vim) does, the code
depends on
[neutil](https://github.com/Neur1n/dotfiles/blob/master/neovim/pack/neur1n/start/neutil).
